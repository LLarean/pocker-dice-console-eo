A console-based poker dice game written in C# as a practice project for exploring [Elegant Objects](https://www.elegantobjects.org/) principles by Yegor Bugayenko, implementing unit tests, and maintaining high code quality standards.

## About the Game

Poker Dice is a classic dice game where players roll dice to form poker-like hands. In this implementation:
- Players can choose which dice to roll in the console
- The game evaluates the resulting dice combination
- The corresponding poker hand is displayed (e.g., Full House, Three of a Kind, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 9.0 or higher)
- Visual Studio, Rider, or any C# compatible IDE

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LLarean/pocker-dice-console-eo.git
cd pocker-dice-console-eo
dotnet restore
```

### Running the Game
```bash
dotnet run
```

### Running Tests
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Project Goals

This project serves as a practical exercise for:
- Applying Elegant Objects principles in real-world scenarios
- Exploring object-oriented design patterns
- Writing clean, testable, and maintainable code
- Practicing test-driven development (TDD)
- Maintaining high code quality standards
